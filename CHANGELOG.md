# Changelog

## v0.3.0

* Redesigned the multiplayer menu with clearer sections, player cards, compact connection details and a scrollable layout for smaller screens.
* Added a visible shot order in the HUD and player list. The host keeps the current turn in sync, including for players who join mid-session, and advances it after each shot or when the active player leaves. Shot order is a guide; it does not block anyone from playing.
* **Protocol v3 — everyone in a session needs v0.3.0.** Older clients are refused with a message telling them to update.

## v0.2.0

* **Front Nine scoreboard.** Everyone's card side by side in the F8 menu and on a new **F9** overlay: hole, par,
  a row per player, totals and score against par. The hole a player is on shows their strokes so far.
  Scores come from the game's own counters, so water and retake penalties are included and skipped holes score par.
  A row resets when that player presses the red button, and stops when they finish the ninth hole.
* Cards are sent to players who join mid-round, so latecomers see the round so far.
* Avatar colours are more vivid, and name tags are larger and easier to read.
* A ball's name marker is hidden while the ball sits at its owner's feet.
* Harmony patches are now applied one by one, so a future game update disables a single feature instead of the whole mod.
* **Protocol v2 — everyone in a session needs v0.2.0.** Older clients are refused with a message telling them to update.

## v0.1.0

First release.

* See other players on the course: walking, crouching, looking around, with name tags in each player's colour.
* Golf stances and swings, animated in time with the real shot, plus the club-hit sound placed in the world.
* Every player's ball: flight, trail in their colour, where it lands, and the ball skin they picked.
* Hole-out announcements.
* Direct IP:port hosting and joining, with optional password, player list, ping, distances and chat.
* "Go to" button to teleport next to another player while walking.
